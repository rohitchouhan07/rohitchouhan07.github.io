<h2>About me</h2>
<hr/>
<img style="float:right;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 20%;height: 20%" src="./pictures/profile.jpg" alt="my picture">
I am a computer science master's student at Stony Brook University, NY. My interest areas are
    systems security and operating systems. Currently working towards my MS thesis on Binary instrumentation under the guidance of Prof. R. Sekar.
    <br>
    I am on a lookout for Software Engineering roles starting June 2023.
    Please checkout my resume for more details.
    <br>
I am a Potterhead and spidey fan who also enjoy playing CSGO, rocket league, and other PC games. I also like reading books and listening
to podcasts and music in the free time.

<h2>Software I am currently using</h2>
<hr/>
<h4>Operating System</h4>
I am currently using <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">EndevourOS</a> is an Arch Based Linux distribution, I always prefer using Linux on my personal machines.
I also recommend people to make a switch from Ubuntu to Arch based distributions, there is much more offered here in the Arch world.
<h4>Desktop Environment</h4>
Using <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a>, polybar and sxhkd. Bspwm is a tiling window manager which tiles windows automatically onto the screen.
If you are using Linux and haven't checked out any tiling window manager. I highly recommend trying one. It would feel
like a new way to interact with your computer. It is far more efficient than a traditional desktop environment, and also
looks very cool. :P
<h4>Text editor and IDE</h4>
For smaller tasks and when working with remote VMs I prefer using Vim/NeoVim.
I cannot explain in words the usefulness and extensibility of vim, everyone should spend some time learning vim. 
Vscode is my IDE of choice, but often times when I want to use a GUI text editor I use Geany.
<h3>I recommend having a quick look at the other links before leaving</h3>
