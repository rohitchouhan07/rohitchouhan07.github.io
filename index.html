<h2>About me</h2>
<hr/>
<img style="float:right;display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 20%;height: 20%" src="./pictures/profile.jpg" alt="my picture">
I am MS graduate from Stony Brook University, NY.
My interest areas are systems security and operating systems. I am currently learning Rust programming language.
<br>
I am on a lookout for Software Engineering roles starting ASAP.
Please checkout my resume for more details.
<br>
I am a Potterhead and spidey fan who also enjoy playing CSGO, rocket league, and other PC games. I also like reading books and listening
to podcasts and music in the free time.

<h2>Software I am currently using</h2>
<hr/>
<h4>Operating System</h4>
I use Arch Linux with DWM as the window manager on my personal machine. DWM is an excellent tiling window manager and changes the way
that you interact with your computer. I highly recommend DWM to everyone on Linux.
It is far more efficient than a traditional desktop environment, and also
looks very cool. :P
<h4>Text editor and IDE</h4>
Lately, I have been using Vim for almost everything. VScode is a good text editor too.
I haven't felt the need to use an IDE with the languages and technology that I use.

<h3>I recommend having a quick look at the other links before leaving</h3>
